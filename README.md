<h1>Hi, I’m Yael</h1>
<span><strong>(I’m ok with almost any pronunciation of my name, but always appreciate people asking).</strong></span>
 
<p></p>

<p>This document is intended to give you an idea of who I am, how do I work, and what to expect while we get to know each other better. </p>
<h2>My role</h2>
<p>I am here to:</p>
<ul>
<li>find, retain and grow talent (like you)
<li>make sure you have everything you need to be successful and achieve your goals, to mentor and support you.</li>
<li>create, maintain and support a united and high performance team that relies on one another to work in harmony and deliver excellence and quality.</li> 
<li>make sure that our team is getting what we need to achieve that excellence and do what we know best - amazing code.</li>  
<li>make sure that the workload and timelines are according to the team's availability to avoid overtime and stress.</li>
</ul>

<h2>My values</h2>
<p><strong>Honesty</strong> - I will usually be more upset about lies than about mistakes. We all make mistakes, we all have other things going on besides work, but there is no reason to lie or hide it. Step forward so we can analyze the situation and find a solution as a team. Be accountable. Your success is my success. The team’s success is our success.</p>

<p><strong>Empathy and Respect</strong> - We work with different people from different teams and different backgrounds, but we are also aiming for the same - creating and delivering excellence. Treat everybody with respect and empathy, you don’t know what they’ve been through. </p>

<p><strong>Proactivity and learning</strong> -  As a team, we are expected to work together, help one another and find solutions and ways to keep us improving our work. I value learning. I think that in order to grow both personally and professionally we ought to keep learning and developing new skills.</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>I believe that feedback is critical for success in every environment, but specifically in a high performing team. I’m dedicated to giving you clear and timely feedback and hope that you’ll give me the same. </p>

<p>The purpose of giving the feedback is for you to know at all times how you are doing, what are your strengths (or what should you be doing more of), and what are your challenges (or things you can work to get better at).  I believe that in order to improve, feedback should be given as soon as possible and not wait until the next evaluation period, so I will usually give it during our one-on-ones or sooner if it can’t wait until then.</p>

<p>Just like you, I want to grow and be better, so your feedback is very important to me. It can be something you liked and want me to continue doing, something you think I could do better at or even something you thought I missed or was wrong about. If you can give me this feedback face-to-face in one of our meetings, awesome! If you're only comfortable doing it with an email or a Slack message, I would rather you do that than not bring it up at all. If you're not comfortable giving me some feedback yourself, it means I'm doing something wrong and I'd love for you to give it to someone else you feel comfortable with so they can anonymously relay it to me.</p>

<h2>Communications and One-on-ones</h2>
<p>I know that my calendar looks busy, but you need to know that I will always be available for you if you need me. As a starting point I will add a 30 minute call every other week to have our one-on-one and we can add more meetings if we feel we need them.</p>

<p>The one-on-one is our time to talk and discuss anything you want. I will probably have some things to discuss with you, like updates or feedback but this is primarily a time for you to tell me how you are doing, what’s on your mind, what you need, and of course any feedback you have for me. As said before, there is no need to wait for the next one-on-one, you can always message me and we can meet as you need.</p>

<p>I love to get to know people on a personal level, so I will probably ask you about your hobbies, or if you have pets, and will love to hear everything you want to share with me. If you don’t, that’s ok too.</p>

<p>We live in a new era where most people work remotely from wherever they want. That means that we can rarely be in the same place at the same time, and so most of our meetings will be video calls, so please turn your video on, at least on our one-on-ones. I like seeing the person I’m talking to, so I don’t feel like I’m talking to myself.</p>

<p>You’ll also find on your calendar a 60 minute meeting every week that is called “Dev meets”. This meeting is an informal gathering of the team members to share new ideas, discoveries, blockers or brainstorm. This is also a time I can use to give you updates and reminders. Use this time to learn, to ask or even to show off your new awesome code!</p>

<h2>Working hours</h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, we are in different places around the world, in different time zones, but even if we are in the same place, some of us work better early in the morning while some are able to concentrate better at night. </p>

<p>While we are flexible on that matter, and since we are a team, we need to make sure all of us are available for all the meetings in our calendars. Meetings are scheduled in a shared timeframe and you are expected to participate and be on time.</p>

<p>It is also important to remember that most people have Slack notifications on their phones, so be mindful of that when you are working outside of the shared working hours and you want to send direct messages. You can set Slack to schedule your message for a specific time.  If you receive a message outside of your working hours, feel free to ignore it until you’re online again, unless the message starts with the [URGENT] tag.</p>

<h2>Expectations of you</h2>
<p>In our first meeting, we will discuss a little bit what are your goals, where do you see yourself in 1 and 5 years and what would you like to achieve from this job. Along with the company objectives, we’ll set goals and we’ll work on them during the year. Come prepared.</p>

<p>There will be quarterly instances of feedback regarding the advance on these goals so we can tweak and fix what’s needed, and then we’ll have an annual evaluation period where you’ll be evaluated against these goals.</p>

<p>Growing in this company will depend on you, your proactiveness and learning skills as well as a go get it attitude. I am here to mentor and support you on your way to success, so use me!</p>

<h2>Things you should know about me</h2>
<p>If you ever want to start a casual conversation with me, and don’t know what to talk about, here are a few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am a great listener and will love to get to know you. I will gladly hear about your family and kids, pets, plants, hobbies or anything you want to!</li>
<li>I have 2 kids, 2 cats and 1 dog, and would have more if I had a bigger place.</li>
<li>I am a plant hoarder, and try to be as sustentable as I can. I do my own compost, try to recycle and use as little plastic as I can.</li>
</ul>
